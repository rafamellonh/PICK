# 🚀 **Docker Course** 

Welcome to the intensive Docker course! Over the next 4 days, we will dive deep into the world of containers, explore the technologies behind Docker, and learn best practices for creating and managing images. Let’s get started! 💪

## **📅 Day 1: Introduction to Docker and Containers**

On the first day, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Docker and how it interacts with the Linux kernel.

### Topics:
- What is Docker? 🐳
- Concepts of Containers 🏗️
- Namespaces and cgroups
- Copy-on-write

## **📅 Day 2: Working with Docker Images and Dockerfile**

On the second day, we will focus on Docker images and building optimized containers using Dockerfile.

### Topics:
- Understanding Docker images 📦
- Dockerfile and its parameters
- Setting up `ENTRYPOINT`
- Adding `HEALTHCHECK` to the Dockerfile
- Multistage builds
- Using `ENV` and `ARG`
- Working with Docker Hub: `docker pull` and `docker push`

## **📅 Day 3: Containerized Applications and Security**

Today, we will transform an application into a container image and explore ways to optimize the size and security of our images.

### Topics:
- Transforming an application into a container image 🛠️
- Managing image size and layers
- `distroless` images
- Container security with `trivy` and `docker scout` 🔒
- The importance of digitally signing images
- Signing images with `cosign`

## **📅 Day 4: Working with Volumes in Docker**

On the final day, we will focus on using volumes in Docker for managing persistent data in containers.

### Topics:
- Introduction to Docker volumes
- Types of volumes:
  - `bind` mounts
  - Docker-managed volumes
  - `tmpfs` volumes
